\description{
A dataset of a preregistered factorial survey experiment with a nationally
representative sample of 964 German online users. Participants were presented
with manipulated user comments that included statements associated with
incivil discourse (such as profanity and attacks on arguments) and
intolerant discourse (such as offensive stereotyping and violent threats).
Participants rated the comments, e.g. offensiveness, harm to society, and
their intention to delete the comment containing the statement.
